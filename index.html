                    Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little
                    country girl. One day her mother, having made some cakes,
                    said to her, "Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is
                    doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake,
                    and this little pot of butter.

                    As she was going through the woods, she met with a wolf, who
                    had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not,
                    because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He
                    asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not
                    know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, told
                    him that she was going to visit her ill granny, and give her
                    a cake and a pot of butter.
