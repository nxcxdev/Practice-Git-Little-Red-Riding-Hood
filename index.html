                    Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little
                    country <span class="little_red_riding_hood">girl</span>.
                    One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her,
                    "Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I
                    hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little
                    pot of butter.

                    was going through the woods, she met with a
                    <span class="wolf">wolf</span>, who had a very great mind to
                    eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters
                    working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was
                    going. The poor child, who did not know that it was
                    dangerous to stay and talk to a
                    <span class="wolf">wolf</span>, told him that she was going
                    to visit her ill granny, and give her a cake and a pot of
                    butter.

                    The <span class="wolf">wolf</span> ran as fast as he could,
                    taking the shortest path, and the
                    <span class="little_red_riding_hood">girl</span> took a
                    roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts,
                    running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little
                    flowers. It was not long before the
                    <span class="wolf">wolf</span>arrived at the old woman's
                    house. He knocked at the door and tricked the granny into
                    thinking he was her daughter, who's bringing a cake and a
                    pot of butter. When he entered at the old woman's house, he
                    ate her up in an instant.

                    but the girl believed it was just a consecuence of the cold.
                    She entered the house. The <span class="wolf">wolf</span>,
                    hiding under the blankets of the bed, told her to put the
                    cake and the pot of butter on the table and to get in bed
                    with her granny.
