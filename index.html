                    Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little
                    country girl. One day her mother, having made some cakes,
                    said to her, "Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is
                    doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake,
                    and this little pot of butter.

                    As she was going through the woods, she met with a wolf, who
                    had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not,
                    because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He
                    asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not
                    know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, told
                    him that she was going to visit her ill granny, and give her
                    a cake and a pot of butter.

                    The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path,
                    and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining
                    herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and
                    gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before
                    the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the
                    door and tricked the granny into thinking he was her
                    daughter, who's bringing a cake and a pot of butter. When he
                    entered at the old woman's house, he ate her up in an
                    instant.

                    Little Red Riding Hood arrived sometime later and knocked on
                    the door. The wolf answered with a big voice, but the girl
                    believed it was just a consecuence of the cold. She entered
                    the house. The wolf, hiding under the blankets of the bed,
                    told her to put the cake and the pot of butter on the table
                    and to get in bed with her granny.
